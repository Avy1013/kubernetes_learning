Problem:

>> Unable to access Nginx service in Minikube using NodePort

Solution:

>> Used " minikube service ng-service " to create a tunnel
>> Alternatively, used --> kubectl port-forward service/ng-service 30007:8080

Miscellaneous / nuanced stuff:

>> NodePort not directly accessible with Docker driver on macOS
>> Port forwarding is temporary, suitable for development
>> NodePort is persistent, better for production scenarios
>> Port forwarding bypasses Kubernetes networking, connects directly to service
>> NodePort exposes service on all nodes, allows external access.
