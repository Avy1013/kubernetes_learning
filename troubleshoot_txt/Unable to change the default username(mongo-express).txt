### Troubleshooting Notes

**What was the problem:**  
>> Unable to change the default username ("admin") and password ("pass") in mongo-express for authentication.

**What was the solution:**  
>> Updated the Kubernetes deployment to reference the correct username and password from a Kubernetes Secret.  
>> Set environment variables in the mongo-express deployment to configure Basic Authentication and MongoDB credentials.

**Commands used:**  
>> Check logs for mongo-express:  
>> kubectl logs mongo-express-<pod-name>  
>> Check environment variables in mongo-express pod:  
>> kubectl -- exec -it mongo-express-<pod-name> -- env  
>> Retrieve the Secret:  
>> kubectl get secret mongodb-secret -o yaml  
>> Edit the mongo-express deployment (YAML) to set environment variables for authentication.

**Miscellaneous / nuanced stuff:**  
>> Verified that `ME_CONFIG_BASICAUTH` was set to true to enable Basic Authentication.  
>> Utilized `valueFrom` in the deployment YAML to securely inject username and password from the Secret into the environment variables.  
>> Double-checked that `ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINUSERNAME` and `ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINPASSWORD` were set correctly from the Secret.
